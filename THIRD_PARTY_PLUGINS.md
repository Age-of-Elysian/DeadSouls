## Compatible 3rd party plugins
This list is just for documentation of what was needed to make these plugins compatible.
**I do not endorse any of these plugins and compatibility with any plugin is not guaranteed.**
Even plugins on this list may not work properly, because I do not keep up with their updates
and I do not test the compatibility - this is left to you, the user.
